# CRA
This was my summer internship project where I developed and deployed a Spring Boot application named CRA, which is a cloud-based, scalable, and flexible solution for managing timesheets for multi-project assignments. It implements the CQRS design pattern and a microservices architecture, using both MySQL and NoSQL databases.
